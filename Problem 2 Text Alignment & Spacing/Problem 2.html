    <h1>The Science of Nuclear Fission</h1>
    <h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
    <p>Nuclear fission is a process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, along with the release of a significant amount of energy. This process is fundamental to the operation of nuclear reactors and atomic bombs. The discovery of nuclear fission in the late 1930s marked a pivotal moment in science and technology, leading to both the development of nuclear power and the creation of nuclear weapons.</p>
    <p>During nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239 absorbs a neutron and becomes unstable. This instability causes the nucleus to split into two lighter nuclei, releasing additional neutrons and a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. The released neutrons can then initiate further fission reactions, creating a chain reaction that can be harnessed for energy production or, in the case of nuclear weapons, result in a massive explosion.</p>
